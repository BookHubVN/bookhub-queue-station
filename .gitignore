# Celery specific files
# Celery may create temporary files for results or state, though usually Redis handles this.
# If you run Celery with file-based results or state, you might need to add paths here.
# For Redis backend, this is usually not needed.

# Docker files (if they generate local artifacts not meant for git)
# If Docker context for build is the root, then no need to ignore .dockerignore here.
# If you are building local images you might want to ignore those.
# .dockerignore # Don't ignore .dockerignore itself

# Project specific temporary files
# Add any other temporary files your project generates
